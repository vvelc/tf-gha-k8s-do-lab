# DevOps Practice Lab

Welcome to this DevOps Practice Lab, where you will see the DevOps knowledge that I have learned so far put into practice, such as how to configure and manage cloud infrastructure, deploy a Kubernetes cluster, automate deployments with ArgoCD and GitHub Actions, and much more

## Goals

The main objectives of this laboratory are:

- Set up a cloud infrastructure using Terraform and DigitalOcean.
- Deploy and manage a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud.
- Configure and use ArgoCD for continuous deployment.
